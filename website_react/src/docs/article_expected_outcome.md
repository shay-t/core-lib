The best Variable to measure the resilient of our code is:  <b>Time</b>.    
Dose <b>Time</b> give me an advantage?     

We can always convert time into data by asking a simple question like:    
How much money does my development cycle cost after five years? is it cheaper or more expensive?



Sticking to a Single architecture and rules upfront can hold many advantages. you may expect :

### Known architecture over products.
    There are 2 claess. DataAceess, Service. and each one will have different responsebility. 
### Easy to expand.
    It easy to delegate data access that expose API to other data access
### No business logic in a third party application.
    By seperating your product from WEB container. 
### Damage control/Risk Management.    
    By separating responsibilities into 3 different layers.  
### Resilient to changes 
    
### Declarative code.
### Readable code.
### Longevity.
### Micro-service architecture.
### Reuse-ability of business logic and data calls.
### Unit test the entire application and business logic.
### Less dependency on third party WEB interface make it easier to choose one.
### More interfaces to serve our product
