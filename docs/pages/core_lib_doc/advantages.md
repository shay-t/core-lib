# Advantages



#### It can be deployed anywhere.

Running/Debugging `Core-Lib` is simple as running the `__main__` function.
`Core-Lib` class instance can be placed after any interface such as `UnitTest`, ` WEB`, `Microservice`, And more.

#### Unit test your entire product.

Cover all your library code and dependent libraries with `unit-test`. 


#### Write code that matters.

`Core-Lib` delegates operations that frequently repeat into tools and decorators such as  `Cache`, `Transform Data`, `RuleValidator`, etc. Leaving you to focus on the problem at hand.

#### Short learning curve.

`Core-Lib` provides out-of-the-box a tiny subset of simple tools that are easy to master. 

#### Risk management

`Core-Lib` does not delegate any third-party dependencies. It provides unique tools to manage multiple dependencies rather than being dependent on a single dependency with a risk of becoming obsolete. 


#### Divide and Conquer

With `Core-Lib`, it's easy to break, separate or change an existing product into smaller libraries (`Core-Libs`) and `Data-Layers` that are easier to read, develop, pinpoint a problem, and test.

#### Longevity

`Core-Lib` embraces the `Onion Architecture` [1](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_misc/designtechniques/understanding-onion-architecture.html) [2](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNT0NhYbUZLnDQbC9b6uPBqjZmjwgw%3A1579104811273&ei=KzofXuOfEO3IgwfngLPwAg&q=onion+Architecture&oq=onion+Architecture&gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0..109691...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.oEYi3afxy_c&ved=0ahUKEwij4drq_4XnAhVt5OAKHWfADC4Q4dUDCAs)  for code reuse and data flow across libraries. Reusing code and moving logic from one `Data-Layer` to another is straightforward.

#### Discover other Core-Lib's

`Core-Lib` uses [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) to discover other `Core-Libs` configurations. And instantiate `Core-Lib` and its dependencies from config.

#### Shared knowledge

Architecture, code structure, problem resolution, state of mind, approach, knowledge, and experience will be almost the same from one `Core-Lib` to another.
