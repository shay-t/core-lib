# Advantages



#### It can be deployed anywhere.

Running `Core-Lib` is simple as running a `__main__` function inside the `IDE`. `Core-Lib` class instance can be placed after any interface such as `UnitTest`, ` WEB`, `Microservice`, And more.

#### Unit test your entire product.

Unit-testing and debugging the entire product locally on your `IDE` saves time = ?. 


#### Write code that matters.

`Core-Lib` delegates operations that frequently repeat into tools and decorators such as  `Cache`, `Transform Data`, `RuleValidator`, etc. Leaving you to to focus on the problem at hand.

#### Short learning curve.

`Core-Lib` provides out-of-the-box a tiny subset of simple tools that make it easy to master. 

#### Risk management

`Core-Lib` provides simple tools to solve problems without abstracting third-party dependencies. Relying on multiple dependencies rather than one is risk management. When one dependence is obsolete, it affects only a subset of the code. 


#### Shared knowledge

Architecture, code structure, state of mind, approach, knowledge, experience, and problem resolution will be almost the same from one `Core-Lib` to another.


#### Divide and Conquer

`Core-Lib` makes it easy to break a product into `Services`, ` Data-Layers`, And other `Core-Libs`. Creating smaller units that are easier to read, develop, pinpoint a problem, and test.

#### Easy to scale, And Longevity

`Core-Lib` embraces the `Onion Architecture` for data flow across libraries. By rewiring and expending data layers. Such as `Services` and `DataAccess.` We are spreading the logic across the library, preventing busy and complex code while encouraging code reuse. 

#### Configuration on adtroied 

`Core-Lib` uses [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for config, discovering and inheriting other Core-Libs configurations, and instantiating dependencies from config.
