# Advantages



#### Can be deployed anywhere

Running `Core-Lib` is simple as running a `__main__` function inside the `IDE`. `Core-Lib` code instance can be placed after any interface such as `UnitTest`, ` WEB`, `Microservice`, And more.



#### Unit test your entire product

Unit-testing and debugging of the entire product locally on your `IDE` saves resources such as money and time. 


#### Write code that matters.

`Core-Lib` delegates operations that frequently repeat into tools and decorators such as  `Cache`, `Transform Data`, `RuleValidator`, And more. Leaving you to write your product code alone.



#### Short learning curve.

`Core-Lib` provides out-of-the-box a tiny subset of simple tools that make it easy to master. 


#### Shared knowledge

Architecture, code structure, state of mind, approach, knowledge, experience, and problem resolution will be almost the same from one `Core-Lib` to another.


#### Divide and Conquer

`Core-Lib` module can be easily broken into `Services`, `Data-Layers`, And other `Core-Libs`.  
A small subset of chunks is easier to read, pinpoint a problem, and test.

#### Easy to scale, And Longevity

`Core-Lib` embraces the `Onion Architecture` for data flow across your library. By expanding/changing branches and leaves of `Services`, ` DataAccess`. We are spreading the logic across the library, preventing busy and complex code while encouraging code reuse. 

#### Risk management

`Core-Lib` provides simple helpers tools to use dependencies. Without abstraction of third-party code.

direct use of multiple third-party changes holds advantages such as

- Changing a third-party dependency will affect only a subset of our code. 

- Learning third-party libraries directly without also learning the abstraction as well
