The best variable to measure the resilience of our code is **Time**.    
Does **Time** give me an advantage?     

We can always convert time into data by asking a simple question like:    
How much money does my development cycle cost after five years? is it cheaper or more expensive?



Sticking to a Single architecture and rules upfront can hold many advantages you may expect:

### Known architecture over products.
There is 2 class. DataAccess, Service. and each one will have a different responsibility. 
### Easy to expand.
It is easy to delegate data access that exposes API to other data access
### No business logic in a third-party application.
By separating your product from the WEB container. 
### Damage control/Risk Management.    
By separating responsibilities into 3 different layers.  
### Resilient to changes 
    
### Declarative code.
### Readable code.
### Longevity.
### Microservice architecture.
### Reuse-ability of business logic and data calls.
### Unit test the entire application and business logic.
### Less dependency on third-party WEB interface make it easier to choose one.
### More interfaces to serve our product
