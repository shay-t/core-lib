# Why?
The reason for creating core-lib came from the belief that the "work itself" is an important factor to consider when selecting a "Back-end Framework" for your next application.

`Core-Lib` is just architecture with some tools.


The efficiency of day-to-day work take a big role in how fast the organizations move.

**Effect on the product scale over time?**

- Better clear code.
- Short learning curve.
- Don't add complexity over time.
- No spaghetti code.
- Simple code (complexity costs more money over time).

Uses the Onion Architecture to release dependencies and complexity. 

Risk management:
- Can be adopted anywhere library

# Why not just use a Web framework?

1. `Core-Lib` is an independent library. 
2. No third-party dependency. 
3. Write your business logic inside your classes.
4. Can be used as a simple library or after a WEB interface. 
5. Same architecture and code style for multiple libraries. 
6. Base classes are just empty classes.  


## Who Is This For?

Everyone who wants single architecture and a simple implementation framework.
