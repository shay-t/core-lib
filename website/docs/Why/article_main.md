# Why?
The reason for creating core-lib came from the belief that the "work itself" is an important factor to consider when selecting a "Back-end Framework" for your next application.

`Core-Lib` is just architecture with some tool.


The efficiency of day to day work take a big role on how fast the organizations move.

**Effect on the product scale over time?**

- Better clear code.
- Short learning curve.
- Don't add complexity over time .
- No spaghetti code.
- Simple code (complexity cost more money over time).

Uses the Onion Architecture to release dependencies, complexity. 

Risk management:
- Can be adopted anywhere library

# Why not you just use a Web framework?

1. `Core-Lib` is an independent library. 
2. No third party dependency. 
3. Write your business logic inside your classes.
4. Can be used as simple library or after a WEB interface. 
5. Same architecture and code style for multiple libraries. 
6. Base classes are just empty classes.  


## Who Is This For?

Every One who want single architecture and simple implementation framework.
