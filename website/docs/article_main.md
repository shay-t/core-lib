# Why

Data Flow is a subject I am fascinated about.    
Since it have a direct effect on how our product scale over time.

an efficient data flows is important, for the application code And also for how a development environment perform.
the effiency of day to day work take a big role on how fast the organizations move.

imagine a scenario.
two startup that have similar value for in the market place, similar budget, same technologies, same market, same country, same taxes, same salery prices, same 24 hours a day
one will do well then the other for many reasons and factors. 

single important factor is how fast you are moving compering to the other. 
how much time you have to make mistakes, evolve and try new things.

     
The data flows describes our code and classes. 
And Growth of code in the long run it's something that we need to consider at the beginning of a project.     

Risk management: ......

In a rapid moving world where everything become more small and more portable. 
making our code a library opens up more options to deploy our products after many types of interfaces. 

First i will describe the reason WHY keeping a tight relationship with a WEB Framework can be problematic when trying to choose the correct Data Flow when planned to run long.   

Second I will share how we can embrace the Onion Architecture to release dependencies, complexity. 
And create an easy data structure to work with.    
Encapsulated in a library that can be adopted anywhere .

# The Poplar 

WEB framework are a good choice to make. They are offering many advantages like:     
rapid code writing, top picked dependencies and capabilities for our disposal, All of our expertise in a single place and more.

For me it's the question. Are we choosing a WEB Framework by it's Data Flow Or our decisions effected by  other advantages ?

To many advantages there are a couple of disadvantages:

1. Our product Data Flow is DICTATED by a third party REST Interface.
2. Our product is highly dependent on a third party library that we have no control of.
3. Sometimes We dependent on a Single wrapper that delegate many third party libraries.  

## Who Is This For

Every One who wants more control over their products.
