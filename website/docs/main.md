# What is Core-Lib

`CoreLib` provides basic/simple/loose tools, utilities and classes for building a WEB Application as a Library using the Onion Architecture. [1](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_misc/designtechniques/understanding-onion-architecture.html) [2](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNT0NhYbUZLnDQbC9b6uPBqjZmjwgw%3A1579104811273&ei=KzofXuOfEO3IgwfngLPwAg&q=onion+Architecture&oq=onion+Architecture&gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0..109691...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.oEYi3afxy_c&ved=0ahUKEwij4drq_4XnAhVt5OAKHWfADC4Q4dUDCAs)
`CoreLib` is a plugin and plug-able to other `CoreLib's`   

# Why Core-Lib

The main reason is the Tight Coupling of our products to a third party application the WEB Framework.   
by taking this into account Core-Lib will not delegate any other framework classes.    
it will only provide basic tools to arrange our code more efficiently.

# Approach
The idea behind it is that no matter how strict! a framework API is. 
We will still not follow it guide lines by intention or mistake.
This is the reason why `Core-Lib` gives only simple utilities and recommendations. 
follow the rules if you wish

## Pros
* Easy to use
* Use dependencies directly (no third party delegation of third party libraries)
* Leverage Onion Architecture for fast expansion.
* Simple mechanisms   

## Cons
* Manage many vendors
