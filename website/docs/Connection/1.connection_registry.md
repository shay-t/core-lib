`Connection` and `ConnectionRegistry` are the base classes that are being implemented by other handlers that the `Core-Lib` makes use of.  
`ConnectionRegistry` provides an easy way to work with connections while being a `Context Manager as a Class`, more info on `Context Manager as a Class` [here](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html#implementing-a-context-manager-as-a-class).

# Connection

*core_lib.connection.connection.Connection* [[source]](https://github.com/shay-te/core-lib/blob/058dead7fa30e1a2b4531f698da95c5380ca8d55/core_lib/connection/connection.py#L5)

Provides 2 abstract methods and is responsible to store a client, session, driver, engine, etc.

## Functions

### \_\_enter\_\_()

*core_lib.connection.connection.Connection.\_\_enter\_\_()* [[source]](https://github.com/shay-te/core-lib/blob/058dead7fa30e1a2b4531f698da95c5380ca8d55/core_lib/connection/connection.py#L7)

Python context manager method. Used to return the session or the client when used with the `with` statement.

```python
@abstractmethod
def __enter__(self):
```

### \_\_exit\_\_()

*core_lib.connection.connection.Connection.\_\_exit\_\_()* [[source]](https://github.com/shay-te/core-lib/blob/058dead7fa30e1a2b4531f698da95c5380ca8d55/core_lib/connection/connection.py#L7)

Python context manager method that takes care of releasing the resources occupied. 

```python
@abstractmethod
def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
```

# ConnectionRegistry

*core_lib.connection.connection_registry.ConnectionRegistry* [[source]](https://github.com/shay-te/core-lib/blob/058dead7fa30e1a2b4531f698da95c5380ca8d55/core_lib/connection/connection_registry.py#L6)

An abstract class to be implemented by the user, it extends the `Registry` class that provides the `get()` function which also is to be implemented, that will return the `Connection` instance for every `ConnectionRegistry`.
